# Hang-git

A hangman game to help Makers students learn git command-line.

## Prerequisites

```
git clone https://github.com/cms718/hang-git
```

## Setup

We start by cloning the empty repository with the same name we are going to use, and then we write in our terminal:

```
npx create-react-app hang-git
```

This will create the structure for react with all the needed folders and repositories.
after that we enter in our working folder with:

```
cd hang-git
```

and to start the server:

```
npm start or yarn start
```

### Running tests

To start testing:
`yarn test`
